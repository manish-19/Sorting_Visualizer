<p>
  Bubble Sort is an iterative sorting algorithm that imitates the movement of
  bubbles in sparkling water. The bubbles represents the elements of the data
  structure.
</p>
<p>
  The bigger bubbles reach the top faster than smaller bubbles, and this
  algorithm works in the same way. It iterates through the data structure and
  for each cycle compares the current element with the next one, swapping them
  if they are in the wrong order.
</p>
<p>
  It's a simple algorithm to implement, but not much efficient: on average,
  quadratic sorting algorithms with the same time complexity such as
  <a href="/2">Selection Sort</a> or
  <a href="/3">Insertion Sort</a> perform better.<br />
